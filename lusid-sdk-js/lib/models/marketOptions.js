 * The set of options that control miscellaneous and default market resolution

 * fine tune the way that data is resolved.
 * For clients who wish to simply match instruments to prices this is quite
 * possibly sufficient. For those wishing to control market data sources
 * according to requirements based on accuracy or timeliness it is not. In more
 * advanced cases the options should largely be ignored and rules specified
 * per source. Be aware that where no specified rule matches the final fallback
