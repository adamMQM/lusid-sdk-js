  /**
   * Create a ValuationReconciliationRequest.
   * @property {object} portfolioId The id of the portfolio on which to run the

   * @property {string} [portfolioId.code]
   * @property {object} aggregation The specification of the aggregation
   * request to be used to obtain the risk
   * @property {object} [aggregation.recipeId] The configuration recipe,
   * consisting of user scope and recipe name, to use in performing the
   * aggregation.
   * @property {string} [aggregation.recipeId.scope]
   * @property {string} [aggregation.recipeId.code]
   * @property {date} [aggregation.asAt] The asAt date to use
   * @property {date} [aggregation.effectiveAt] The market data time, i.e. the
   * time to run the aggregation request effective of.
   * @property {array} [aggregation.metrics] The set of specifications for
   * items to calculate or retrieve during the aggregation and present in the
   * results.
   * This is logically equivalent to the set of operations in a Sql select
   * statement
   * select [operation1(field1), operation2(field2), ... ] from results
   * @property {array} [aggregation.groupBy] The set of items by which to
   * perform grouping. This primarily matters when one or more of the metric
   * operators is a mapping
   * that reduces set size, e.g. sum or proportion. The group-by statement
   * determines the set of keys by which to break the results out.
   * @property {array} [aggregation.filters] A set of filters to use to reduce
   * the data found in a request. Equivalent to the 'where ...' part of a Sql
   * select statement.
   * For example, filter a set of values within a given range or matching a
   * particular value.
   * @property {number} [aggregation.limit] limit the results to a particular
   * number of values.
   * @property {string} [aggregation.sort] Sort the results or not.
