/**

 */
class ValuationReconciliationRequest {
  /**
   * Create a ValuationReconciliationRequest.
   * @property {object} portfolioId The id of the portfolio on which to run the
   * aggregation request
   * @property {string} [portfolioId.scope]
   * @property {string} [portfolioId.code]
   * @property {object} aggregation The specification of the aggregation
   * request to be used to obtain the risk
   * @property {object} [aggregation.recipeId] The configuration recipe,
   * consisting of recipe scope and recipe name, to use in performing the
   * aggregation.
   * @property {string} [aggregation.recipeId.scope]
   * @property {string} [aggregation.recipeId.code]
   * @property {object} [aggregation.inlineRecipe] Target Method for providing
   * a non-named recipe.
   * If given, this replaces the 'RecipeId' used with the bespoke recipe. This
   * is intended to allow use of non-named
   * recipes to iterate quickly for design purposes. Ultimately it is
   * recommended that production recipes would be stored
   * in Lusid.
   *
   * USE OF ANY (INLINE) RECIPE IS AT PRESENT LIABLE TO CHANGE.
   * @property {string} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.code] User given string name
   * (code) to identify the recipe.
   * @property {object} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market] The market
   * configuration node that defines where market data used in processing a
   * request is loaded from and how it is resolved.
   * @property {array} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.marketRules] The set of
   * rules that define how to resolve particular use cases. These can be
   * relatively general or specific in nature.
   * Nominally any number are possible and will be processed in order where
   * applicable. However, there is evidently a potential
   * for increased computational cost where many rules must be applied to
   * resolve data. Ensuring that portfolios are structured in
   * such a way as to reduce the number of rules required is therefore
   * sensible.
   * @property {object} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.suppliers] It is
   * possible to control which supplier is used for a given asset class.
   * @property {string} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.suppliers.commodity]
   * Possible values include: 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.suppliers.credit]
   * Possible values include: 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.suppliers.equity]
   * Possible values include: 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.suppliers.fx] Possible
   * values include: 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.suppliers.rates]
   * Possible values include: 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {object} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.options] Miscellaneous
   * options around market loading. In the simplest usage case, this is just a
   * default supplier and instrument resolution code.
   * @property {string}
   * [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.options.defaultSupplier] The default
   * supplier of data. This controls which 'dialect' is used to find particular
   * market data. e.g. one supplier might address data by RIC, another by
   * PermId. Possible values include: 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string}
   * [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.options.defaultInstrumentCodeType] when
   * instrument quotes are searched for, what identifier should be used by
   * default. Possible values include: 'LusidInstrumentId', 'Figi', 'RIC',
   * 'QuotePermId', 'Isin', 'CurrencyPair'
   * @property {string} [aggregation.inlineRecipe.market.options.defaultScope]
   * for default rules, which scope should data be searched for in
   * @property {date} [aggregation.asAt] The asAt date to use
   * @property {date} [aggregation.effectiveAt] The market data time, i.e. the
   * time to run the aggregation request effective of.
   * @property {array} [aggregation.metrics] The set of specifications for
   * items to calculate or retrieve during the aggregation and present in the
   * results.
   * This is logically equivalent to the set of operations in a Sql select
   * statement
   * select [operation1(field1), operation2(field2), ... ] from results
   * @property {array} [aggregation.groupBy] The set of items by which to
   * perform grouping. This primarily matters when one or more of the metric
   * operators is a mapping
   * that reduces set size, e.g. sum or proportion. The group-by statement
   * determines the set of keys by which to break the results out.
   * @property {array} [aggregation.filters] A set of filters to use to reduce
   * the data found in a request. Equivalent to the 'where ...' part of a Sql
   * select statement.
   * For example, filter a set of values within a given range or matching a
   * particular value.
   * @property {number} [aggregation.limit] limit the results to a particular
   * number of values.
   * @property {string} [aggregation.sort] Sort the results or not.
