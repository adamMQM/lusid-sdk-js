/**

 */
class AggregationRequest {
  /**
   * Create a AggregationRequest.
   * @property {object} recipeId The configuration recipe, consisting of user
   * scope and recipe name, to use in performing the aggregation.
   * @property {string} [recipeId.scope]
   * @property {string} [recipeId.code]
   * @property {date} [asAt] The asAt date to use
   * @property {date} effectiveAt The market data time, i.e. the time to run
   * the aggregation request effective of.
   * @property {array} metrics The set of specifications for items to calculate
   * or retrieve during the aggregation and present in the results.
   * This is logically equivalent to the set of operations in a Sql select
   * statement
   * select [operation1(field1), operation2(field2), ... ] from results
   * @property {array} [groupBy] The set of items by which to perform grouping.
   * This primarily matters when one or more of the metric operators is a
   * mapping
   * that reduces set size, e.g. sum or proportion. The group-by statement
   * determines the set of keys by which to break the results out.
   * @property {array} [filters] A set of filters to use to reduce the data
   * found in a request. Equivalent to the 'where ...' part of a Sql select
   * statement.
   * For example, filter a set of values within a given range or matching a
   * particular value.
   * @property {number} [limit] limit the results to a particular number of
   * values.
   * @property {string} [sort] Sort the results or not.
