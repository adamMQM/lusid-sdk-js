  /**
   * Create a MarketContext.
   * @property {array} [marketRules] The set of rules that define how to
   * resolve particular use cases. These can be relatively general or specific
   * in nature.
   * Nominally any number are possible and will be processed in order where
   * applicable. However, there is evidently a potential
   * for increased computational cost where many rules must be applied to
   * resolve data. Ensuring that portfolios are structured in
   * such a way as to reduce the number of rules required is therefore
   * sensible.
   * @property {object} [suppliers] It is possible to control which supplier is
   * used for a given asset class.
   * @property {string} [suppliers.commodity] Possible values include:
   * 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [suppliers.credit] Possible values include:
   * 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [suppliers.equity] Possible values include:
   * 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [suppliers.fx] Possible values include: 'DataScope',
   * 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [suppliers.rates] Possible values include: 'DataScope',
   * 'Lusid'
   * @property {object} [options] Miscellaneous options around market loading.
   * In the simplest usage case, this is just a default supplier and instrument
   * resolution code.
   * @property {string} [options.defaultSupplier] The default supplier of data.
   * This controls which 'dialect' is used to find particular market data. e.g.
   * one supplier might address data by RIC, another by PermId. Possible values
   * include: 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [options.defaultInstrumentCodeType] when instrument
   * quotes are searched for, what identifier should be used by default.
   * Possible values include: 'LusidInstrumentId', 'Figi', 'RIC',
   * 'QuotePermId', 'Isin', 'CurrencyPair'
   * @property {string} [options.defaultScope] for default rules, which scope
   * should data be searched for in
