class ConfigurationRecipe {
  /**
   * Create a ConfigurationRecipe.
   * @property {string} code User given string name (code) to identify the
   * recipe.
   * @property {object} [market] The market configuration node that defines
   * where market data used in processing a request is loaded from and how it
   * is resolved.
   * @property {array} [market.marketRules] The set of rules that define how to
   * resolve particular use cases. These can be relatively general or specific
   * in nature.
   * Nominally any number are possible and will be processed in order where
   * applicable. However, there is evidently a potential
   * for increased computational cost where many rules must be applied to
   * resolve data. Ensuring that portfolios are structured in
   * such a way as to reduce the number of rules required is therefore
   * sensible.
   * @property {object} [market.suppliers] It is possible to control which
   * supplier is used for a given asset class.
   * @property {string} [market.suppliers.commodity] Possible values include:
   * 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [market.suppliers.credit] Possible values include:
   * 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [market.suppliers.equity] Possible values include:
   * 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [market.suppliers.fx] Possible values include:
   * 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [market.suppliers.rates] Possible values include:
   * 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {object} [market.options] Miscellaneous options around market
   * loading. In the simplest usage case, this is just a default supplier and
   * instrument resolution code.
   * @property {string} [market.options.defaultSupplier] The default supplier
   * of data. This controls which 'dialect' is used to find particular market
   * data. e.g. one supplier might address data by RIC, another by PermId.
   * Possible values include: 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
   * @property {string} [market.options.defaultInstrumentCodeType] when
   * instrument quotes are searched for, what identifier should be used by
   * default. Possible values include: 'LusidInstrumentId', 'Figi', 'RIC',
   * 'QuotePermId', 'Isin', 'CurrencyPair'
   * @property {string} [market.options.defaultScope] for default rules, which
   * scope should data be searched for in
