/**
 * Specification for the reconciliation request. Left and Right hand sides are
 * constructed. Each consists of a valuation of a portfolio
 * using an aggregation request. The results of this can then be compared to
 * each other. The difference, which is effectively a risk based
 * difference allows comparison of the effects of changing a recipe, valuation
 * date, or (though it may or may not make logical sense) a portfolio.
 * For instance, one might look at the difference in risk caused by the
 * addition of transaction to a portfolio, or through changing the valuation
 * methodology or system.
